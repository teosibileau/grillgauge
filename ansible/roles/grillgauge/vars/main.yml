# GrillGauge configuration

# Bluetooth agent configuration
# The bluetooth-agent service enables automatic pairing for BLE devices
# It implements the org.bluez.Agent1 D-Bus interface with NoInputNoOutput capability
# This allows grillgauge to pair with thermometer probes without user interaction
# Service automatically restarts when grillgauge code is updated
